# AT89C51_8_Bit_LCD_Assembly_Proteus
A simple AT89C51 (8051 Series MCU) Assembly Code  for 8 bit LCD Interface and Simulation over Proteus Vr.8.9. MIDE-51 IDE used as Assembler. (All files available.)![AT89C51_8_BIT_LCD_(RW_PIN_TO_GND)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78910261/195871844-f865ab2e-f37a-410d-bc67-f55ceb98696a.png)

!!!! Only the PORT "0" (AT89C51) May not work with LCD while simulating over Proteus. But it works fine in real hardware. So, it may be a limitation for Proteus. However, all other ports have been tested in both simulation over Proteus 8.9 and real hardware.
